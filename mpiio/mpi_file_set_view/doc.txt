int MPI_File_set_view(

  MPI_Datatype etype,
  MPI_Datatype filetype,
  char *datarep,
  MPI_Info info
);

The MPI_FILE_SET_VIEW routine changes the process's view of the data in the file. 

The start of the view is set to disp; 
the type of data is set to etype; 
the distribution of data to processes is set to filetype; 
and the representation of data in the file is set to datarep. 


In addition, MPI_FILE_SET_VIEW resets the individual file pointers and the shared file pointer to zero. 
MPI_FILE_SET_VIEW is collective; the values for datarep and the extents of etype in the file data representation must be identical on all processes in the group; 
values for disp, filetype, and info may vary. 
The datatypes passed in etype and filetype must be committed.
The etype always specifies the data layout in the file. 
If etype is a portable datatype, the extent of etype is computed by scaling any displacements in the datatype to match the file data representation. 
If etype is not a portable datatype, no scaling is done when computing the extent of etype. 
The user must be careful when using nonportable etypes in heterogeneous environments.
If MPI_MODE_SEQUENTIAL mode was specified when the file was opened, the special displacement MPI_DISPLACEMENT_CURRENT must be passed in disp. 
This sets the displacement to the current position of the shared file pointer.

Rationale.
For some sequential files, such as those corresponding to magnetic tapes or streaming network connections, the displacement may not be meaningful. 
MPI_DISPLACEMENT_CURRENT allows the view to be changed for these types of files. ( End of rationale.) 
The disp displacement argument specifies the position (absolute offset in bytes from the beginning of the file) where the view begins.
Advice to users.
disp can be used to skip headers or when the file includes a sequence of data segments that are to be accessed in different patterns (see Figure 15 ). 
Separate views, each using a different displacement and filetype, can be used to access each segment.
